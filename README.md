# Public Health: Influenza Season Preparedness

## Overview
This project analysed the preparedness of hospitals for influenza season in the US and forecasts of influenza cases in 2018 using Tableau.

## Objective
To help staffing agencies maintain the hospital's staff-to-patient ratio above 1.1, with no additional funds to hire more hospital staff.

Key questions to be answered:
1. What is the distribution of influenza deaths by age and region?
2. What factors are correlated with influenza deaths?
3. Forcast influenza deaths into 2018 and 2019.

## Data
The datasets used for the analysis are as follows:
1. Influenza deaths by geography, accessed via [CDC](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76)
2. Population data by geography, time, age and gender provided by Career Foundry, accessed via [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/data/datasets.2010.html)

## Tools
The different tables were checked and cleaned using Excel, and then generated plots for analysis using Tableau Public.
